Regarding the preliminary linguistic analyses performed on the data and discussed in my doctoral dissertation, 
the following provides some insight into the scripts used in order to observe the tarc data. 

The analyses conducted follow three paths: 

-The observation of defined traits of quasi-orality,
-The identification of settling trends in Arabic coding,
-The recognition of a continuum of formality in the textual genres selected for this research. 

We report in the list below the names of the scripts that were created to 
perform the analyses for each section of these analyses.


Quasi-orality traits (section 4.2);
	QuasiOralityAnalyses.py (section 4.2.1)

Spontaneous settling trends (section 4.3);
	Trends.py
	trends_CodeSwitching.py (section 4.3.2)
	trends_koinaisation_q.py (section 4.3.3)
	trends_koinaisation_diphtngs.py (section 4.3.3)
	trends_koinaisation_morphosyntax.py (section 4.3.3)

Continuum of formality degree (section 4.4).
	formality_degree.py (section 4.4.1 e 4.4.2)

The scripts use the tarc.tsv file (which contains all textual genres) to generate the statistical analysis. 
This file contains the <eos> token as a sentence separator, unlike gender-divided data files (i.e. blog.tab where sentences are separated by spaces). 
This is because the analyses were structured in this way. 
Also, the percentages reported in the thesis for the first analyses may vary slightly because they were based on 6 blocks of TArC, 
which was still under construction. 
The percentages reported by the last analyses coincide because they were already carried out on the totality of the TArC data. 


Along with the scripts there are also files loaded that are needed for functions and language support information, 
such as the annotated_coronals.tsv file and the utilities.py file. 

We also load the files automatically generated by the scripts themselves, so that they can be used without having to launch the scripts. 
These are the file Det_follewed_by_foreign.txt, the q_realization.txt, the diphtons_realization.txt and the textgenre_NPdistribution.txt
