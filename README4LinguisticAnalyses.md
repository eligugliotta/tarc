## Linguistic Analyses on TArC - some information 

<br />
<br />

This page provides some insight into the scripts used in order to observe the TArC data.
Regarding the preliminary linguistic analyses performed on the TArC data, these are discussed in my doctoral dissertation. 

<br />

The analyses conducted follow three paths: 

* The observation of quasi-orality traits,
* The identification of settling trends in the Tunisian Arabizi encoding,
* The recognition of a formality continuum in the textual genres selected for this research. 


We report in the list below the names of the scripts that were created to perform each analysis.

<br />

1 Quasi-orality traits (section 4.2);
*	Quasi.orality.py (section 4.2.1)

2 Spontaneous settling trends (section 4.3);
*	Trends.py
*	Trends.CodeSwitching.py (section 4.3.2)
*	Trends.koinaisation.q.py (section 4.3.3)
*	Trends.koinaisation.diphtngs.py (section 4.3.3)
*	Trends.koinaisation.morphosyntax.py (section 4.3.3)

3 Continuum of formality degree (section 4.4).
*	Formality.degree.py (section 4.4.1 e 4.4.2)

<br /> 

The scripts use the **tarc.tsv** file to generate the analyses. The **tarc.tsv** contains the three textual genres researched along with the rap genre.   
This file employs the **\<eos>** token as a sentence separator, unlike the genre-divided data files (i.e. the **blog.tab** where sentences are separated by spaces). 
This is because the analyses were structured in this way. 
The percentages reported in the thesis for the first analyses may vary slightly because they were based on 6 blocks of TArC, 
while the corpus was still under construction. 
Instead, the percentages reported by the last analyses coincide with those reported in the thesis, because the latter were already carried out on the totality of the TArC data. 


Other files containing linguistic information or functions to support the scripts were also uploaded. These are: 
* the *annotated_coronals.tsv* file, and 
* the *utilities.py* file. 

Files automatically generated by the scripts have also been uploaded. Thus, they can be used without having to launch the scripts. 
These are:
* the file *Det_follewed_by_foreign.txt*, 
* the *q_realization.txt*, 
* the *diphtongs_realization.txt* and 
* the *textgenre_NPdistribution.txt*.
